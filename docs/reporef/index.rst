Repository Reference
====================

Templates
---------

Templates for switch configurations.

In the base of this repository there should be one directory for each network operating system
platform, like "eos", "junos" or "iosxr".

In each of these directories there needs to be a file called "mapping.yml", this file defines
what template files should be used for each device type. For example, in mapping.yml there
might be a definition of templates for an access switch specified like this:

::

    ACCESS:
        entrypoint: access.j2
        dependencies:
            - managed-full.j2


This indicates that the starting point for the template of access switches for this platform
is deffined in the Jinja2 template file called "access.j2". Additionally, this template file
will depend on things defined in a file called "managed-full.j2".

The template files themselves are written using the Jinja2 templating language. Variables
that are exposed from CNaaS includes:

- hostname: Short hostname of device

- host: Short hostname of device (implicitly added by nornir-jinja2)

- mgmt_ip: IPv4 management address (ex 192.168.0.10)

- mgmt_ipif: IPv4 management address including prefix length (ex 192.168.0.10/24)

- mgmt_prefixlen: Just the prefix length (ex 24)

- mgmt_vlan_id: VLAN id for management (ex 10)

- mgmt_gw: IPv4 address for the default gateway in the management network

- uplinks: A list of uplink interfaces, each interface is a dictionary with these keys:

  * ifname: Name of the physical interface (ex Ethernet1)

- access_auto: A list of access_auto interfacs. Using same keys as uplinks.

- device_model: Device model string, same as "model" in the device API. Can be
  used if you need model specific configuration lines.

- device_os_version: Device OS version string, same as "os_version" in the
  device API. Can be used if you need OS version specific configuration lines.

- device_id: CNaaS-NMS internal ID number of the device

- stack_members: CNaaS-NMS stack members if they are include. Each stackmember has a hardware id, and member number, priority is optional.

Additional variables available for distribution switches:

- infra_ip: IPv4 infrastructure VRF address (ex 10.199.0.0)

- infra_ipif: IPv4 infrastructure VRF address inc prefix (ex 10.199.0.0/32)

- vrfs: A list of dictionaries with two keys: "name" and "rd" (rd as in Route Distinguisher).
  Populated from settings defined in routing.yml.

- bgp_ipv4_peers: A list of dictionaries with the keys: "peer_hostname", "peer_infra_lo", "peer_ip" and "peer_asn".
  Contains one entry per directly connected dist/core device, used to build an eBGP underlay for the fabric.
  Populated from the links database table.

- bgp_evpn_peers: A list of dictionaries with the keys: "peer_hostname", "peer_infra_lo", "peer_asn".
  Contains one entry per hostname specified in settings->evpn_peers. Used to build
  eBGP peering for EVPN between loopbacks.

- mgmtdomains: A list of dictionaries with the keys: "ipv4_gw", "vlan", "description", "esi_mac".
  Populated from the mgmtdomains database table.

- asn: A private unique Autonomous System number generated from the last two octets
  of the infra_lo IP address on the device.

All settings configured in the settings repository are also exposed to the templates.

.. _settings_repo_ref:

settings
--------

Settings are defined at different levels and inherited (possibly overridden) in several steps.
For example, NTP servers might be defined in the "global" settings to impact the entire
managed network, but then overridden for a specific device type that needs custom NTP servers.
The inheritence is defined in these steps:
Global -> Fabric -> Core/Dist/Access -> Group -> Device specific.
The directory structure looks like this:

- global

  * groups.yml: Definition of custom device groups
  * routing.yml: Definition of global routing settings like fabric underlay and VRFs
  * vxlans.yml: Definition of VXLAN/VLANs
  * base_system.yml: Base system settings

- fabric (core+dist)

  * base_system.yml: Base system settings

- core

  * base_system.yml: Base system settings
  * interfaces_<model>.yml: Model specific default interface settings

- dist

  * base_system.yml: Base system settings
  * interfaces_<model>.yml: Model specific default interface settings

- access:

  * base_system.yml: Base system settings

- groups:

  * <group name>

    + base_system.yml
    + interfaces.yml
    + routing.yml

- devices:

  * <hostname>

    + base_system.yml
    + interfaces.yml
    + routing.yml

groups.yml:

A device in CNaaS-NMS will be a member of exactly one primary group, and
optionally any number of secandary groups. Primary groups can be used to
configure settings per group. Secondary groups can be used to assign VXLAN
memberships, select devices for synchronization or firmware upgrade etc.

groups.yml contains a dictionary named "groups", that contains a list of groups.
Each group is defined as a dictionary with a single key named "group",
and that key contains a dictionary with two keys:

- name: A string representing a name. No spaces.
- regex: A Python style regex that matches on device hostnames.
- group_priority: Optional integer value 0-100. Specifies which group should
  have the highest priority when determining the primary group for a device.
  Higher value means higher priority. Defaults to 0, value of 1 is reserved
  for builtin group DEFAULT.

There will always exist a group called DEFAULT with group_priority 1 even
if it's not specified in groups.yml.

All devices that matches the regex will be included in the group.

::

   groups:
     - group:
         name: 'ALL'
         regex: '.*'
     - group:

interfaces.yml:

For dist and core devices interfaces are configured in YAML files. The
interface configuration can either be done per device, or per device model.
If there is a device specific folder under devices/ then the model
interface settings will be ignored. Model specific YAML files
should be named like the device model as listed in the devices API, but in
all lower-case and with all whitespaces replaced with underscore ("_").

Keys for interfaces.yml or interfaces_<model>.yml:

* interfaces: List of dicctionaries with keys:

  * name: Interface name, like "Ethernet1". Can also be an interface range like "Ethernet[1-4]".
  * ifclass: Interface class, one of: downlink, fabric, custom, port_template_*
  * config: Optional. Raw CLI config used in case "custom" ifclass was selected

* Additional interface options for port_template type:

  * untagged_vlan: Optional. Numeric VLAN ID for untagged frames.
  * tagged_vlan_list: Optional. List of allowed numeric VLAN IDs for tagged frames.
  * description: Optional. Description for the interface, this should be a string 0-64 characters.
  * enabled: Optional. Set the administrative state of the interface. Defaults to true if not set.
  * aggregate_id: Optional. Identifier for configuring LACP etc. Integer value.
    Special value -1 means configure MLAG and use ID based on indexnum.

The "downlink" ifclass is used on DIST devices to specify that this interface
is used to connect access devices. The "fabric" ifclass is used to specify that
this interface is used to connect DIST or CORE devices with each other to form
the switch (vxlan) fabric. Linknet data will only be configured on interfaces
specified as "fabric". If no linknet data is available in the database then
the fabric interface will be configured for ZTP of DIST/CORE devices by
providing DHCP (relay) access.
"port_template_*" is used to specify a user defined port template. This can then
be used to apply some site-specific configuration via Jinja templates. For
example specify "port_template_hypervisor" and build a corresponding Jinja
template by matching on that ifclass.

internal_vlans can optionally be specified if you want to manually define
the range of internal VLANs on L3 switches. You can also specify the option
"allocation_order" under internal_vlans which is a custom string that defaults
to "ascending". If internal_vlans is specified then a collision check will
be performed for any defined vlan_ids in vxlans settings.
